# Power Panel
Select widget in the normal way.
Options are Sensor and BattSize
  You can choose any sensor or input.
  The widget will divide that by the total (BattSize) and report the remaining percentage.
  I.E: 1 - used/total
  But, it was intended for battery use.
  
  BattSize is the total.
  it must be multiplied by 100 (35 = 3500mAh)
  Sorry. I know it's wonky. I can set the default to 3500, but scrolling to set a different value is limited to 0 - 100 by OpenTX.
  
Voice calls are at 10% intervals above 10% remaining and then 5% intervals below.

All widget sizes are working except XL. It isn't finished yet.

Lastly, let me know if there are things you think might work better.
  I ignore most anything that isn't accompanied by a pint of Guiness...just saying! ;)
